About Me
======
I am passionate and driven to solve social issues with technology. As someone dedicated to lifelong learning, I'm also constantly exploring my interests ranging from education to self-development.

Beginning in high school, I spearheaded an initiative to begin my school's first Girls Who Code Chapter. After graduated in the midst of the pandemic, I facilitated and advised youth leaders to address inequities in our communities as part of the SummerYouthBank2020 program.

This spring while studying at UMN, I'm continuing to demonstrate my passion for computer science as a teaching assistant. Additionally, I research, explain, and clarify key issues with privacy and misinformation as part of humanID. I also co-founded Carene-id, a community-based literacy initiative. On the side, I'm also learning about and sharing my insights on the tech industry as a writer at Candor.

This summer, I am conducting research as part of the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU) program.

As part of my promise to learning beyond school, I:
- write anything from technical content to short stories
- keep up with content from those I admire and respect (LinkedIn, books, blogs, etc.)
- strive to develop a multifaceted approach to learning by appreciating the arts and humanities just as much as the sciences

My priorities in a nutshell:
1 | family
2 | solving key global issues
3 | exploring and pushing the boundaries of what life has to offer
